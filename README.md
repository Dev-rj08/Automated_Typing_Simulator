Description:
The "Python Typing Simulator" is a Python script designed to emulate the action of typing on a keyboard, providing a convenient way to automate the input of text into various applications and scenarios. This script utilizes the pyautogui library to replicate human-like typing behavior, making it useful for tasks that involve repetitive text input.

Features:

Customizable Text Input: The script allows users to define the text that needs to be simulated. This can range from individual words to full paragraphs.

Natural Typing Pace: To mimic human typing, the script includes an option to set a time interval between each simulated key press. This interval creates a realistic and natural typing rhythm.

Versatility: The simulator can be applied to various use cases, such as automating data entry, filling out forms, or scripting interactions in applications.

Ease of Use: The straightforward structure of the script makes it accessible to users with minimal programming experience. Users only need to specify the text and desired typing speed.

Usage:

Install Dependencies: Ensure that the pyautogui library is installed using the command pip install pyautogui.

Run the Script: Execute the script using a Python interpreter. The script will simulate typing the specified text at the defined typing interval.
